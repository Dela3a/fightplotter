The code basically runs battles between your Hero and a Monster and plots the winrate using matplotlib
each one has 4 attributes (Atk, critacal chance, critical damage, health)
the 1st set of 4 text boxes define: Atk, CritC, CritDmg, Health for the Hero
the 2nd set of 4 text boxes define: Atk, CritC, CritDmg, Health for the Monster
the last set of boxes sets the simualtion arguments
click on the start simualtion button start the calculations

The project depends on:
PyGobject
matplotlib
